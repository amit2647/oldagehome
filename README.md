The app designed for NGO is a helpful tool for old people. It utilizes Firebase for user registration and incorporates various features to enhance the user experience. Here is an overview of the app's functionalities:

  User Registration: The app allows users to register themselves by providing necessary details such as name, contact information, and possibly age-related information. This registration process helps in identifying and managing the users within the system.

  Organization Details: The app provides information about organizations that cater to the needs of old people. This information includes details about the organization's mission, services provided, location, contact information, and any other relevant information to help users understand and connect with the organization.

  Donation Feature: The app allows users to make donations to support the organization's cause. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting the donation amount and payment method, ensuring a seamless donation process. The app may integrate with payment gateways or utilize Firebase's in-app purchase capabilities to facilitate secure transactions.

  List of Basic Needs: The app provides a comprehensive list of basic needs for old people, such as medicines, clothing, groceries, and other essential items. This list is made available through the app, allowing users to view and request these items as needed. The app may include features like searching, filtering, and sorting to help users find specific items efficiently.

  Organization-User Interaction: The app enables communication between users and the organization. Users can submit requests for specific needs, communicate any concerns or queries, and receive responses or updates from the organization through the app's messaging or notification system.

  Admin Login: The app includes a separate login functionality for administrators or organization representatives. This admin login allows authorized personnel to access a dedicated dashboard or interface where they can view the list of registered users, manage donation records, monitor user requests, and perform administrative tasks to streamline operations.

  Firebase Integration: The app leverages Firebase services such as Firebase Authentication for user registration and authentication, Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for storing user data, organization details, and donation records. It may also use Firebase Cloud Messaging for sending notifications to users or admins.

The primary objective of this app is to provide a user-friendly platform for old people to connect with organizations that support them. It enables seamless registration, facilitates donations, offers access to basic needs, and allows communication between users and organizations. The admin login ensures efficient management and monitoring of user activities within the app.
